WMGC 2020 winter tournament.

We had a respectable turnout of 18 players.  There were 3 double-digit kyu
players, with the remaining players from 3-kyu to 5-dan.  Players traveled from
throughout New England: 200+ mi from VT, by Uber and bus from Boston, and several
players from NY City.

David Richardson (14k) won the DDK division.

Four players had 3-1 results.  Details with the picture below.

Just one player had a perfect 4-0 record: Minghan Jiang
