<PRE>
People need to Scroll Up using the arrow in the lower left corner
until Lederle Graduate Research Center is visible.  I recommend
people park in the purple lot between the Lederle Graduate Research
Center and the West Experiment Station.  It is a parking meter lot
but no need to put in money on Sunday.  DO NOT PARK in any space in
that lot that does NOT have a parking meter as you will likely be
towed.

If that lot is full (which is very unlikely after the UMass
graduation on Saturday) then park in the part of lot 43 just
east of Arnold House [access to that lot is from Governors Drive]
OR lot 63 [access to that lot is from North Pleasant St. using a
little road just to the north of the Integrated Sciences Building.]
Since UMass graduation is Saturday virtually all of the lots
mentioned above should be nearly empty unless something is going
on that I haven't heard about.

By the way the entrance to the 17 story building where the
tournament is held, 1634 Lederle Graduate Research Tower, is via
the footpath between the purple metered lot described above and
the Lederle Graduate Research Center.  Just head west on that
path until you reach the 17 story building and then turn right
(= North) to the building entrance which will be on your left.
Enter the building and take the elevator to the 16th floor.
When you get off the elevator take a right and proceed ahead
to the room (1634) where the tournament is held.
