<H3> Western Massachusetts Go Club</H3>
We play Go (wei qi, baduk) every week in Western Massachusetts, mainly Amherst and Northampton. Go is a fascinating 4,000 year-old board game played by millions worldwide. We welcome newcomers, and are happy to teach the game to anyone. We travel to nearby tournaments in Boston, Connecticut, and elsewhere, and we also host tournaments of our own.
<p>
Thanks to the <A href="http://www.usgo.org/">American Go Association</A> for 
hosting our web-site.
