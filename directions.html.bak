      <P>Directions to our Monday meetings in <B>Amherst</B> (Rao's Coffee).  These are good from North, South, East or West:</P>
      <P >Take I-91 to <B>Exit 19</B> (Hadley / Northampton). At the end of the offramp, take a right 
        on Rte. 9 East. You'll immediately cross the Cooley Dickinson Bridge. </P>

<P>
        Continue straight on Rte. 9 until you get to Amherst.  At
the first set of lights in downtown Amherst, take a left.  (You'll see the town common on your left, and Amherst College on your right.  If you start to pass a lot of raised crosswalks, then you've gone too far.)  </P>

<P>Go down Pleasant Street.  Turn right on Kellogg street.  Park anywhere.</P>

The address is 17 Kellogg Ave, Amherst MA 01002.  <BR>
