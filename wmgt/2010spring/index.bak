We had an exciting tournament in Amherst, MA on Sunday, May 16, 2010.  Going into the fourth round, there were no three game winners, so the top spots were up for grabs.  Trevor Morris (3-1) eeked out David Saxner (3-1) by 1 tie-break point to win the tournament trophy.  Eric Reid was the only kyu player to post a 3-1 record, clinching the kyu title.  Special mention goes to Richard Buckman (2-1) who volunteered to take a bye in the second round after a first round loss.  Rich managed to pick up wins in his last two games, for a respectable winning record.
