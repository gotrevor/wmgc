 2d (3-1), 
<A href="P0231140.JPG">Richard
Buckman</A> 7k (3-1), 
<A href="P0231141.JPG">William Luff</A> 10k (3-1).  A special mention to 
<A href="P0231144.JPG">Teddy
Feldman</A> who went 2-1 and might've had three wins had she not
volunteered to take a bye in the second round to even out the field.
<P>
Special thanks to Micah Feldman (the guy handing out all
the prizes in the linked images above) for organizing the tournament,
bringing the bagels, arranging for the beatiful trophy, etc.  Micah
was also a good sport about having his first bye ever, due to a
pairing snafu in the first round.
<P>
Thanks to the math professor Arunas Rudvalis, who sadly didn't play in the tournament,
for arranging for the use of the room, and making sure that we left it
in tidy shape.
<P>
Thanks also to Scott Magnoni, a Sr. at UMass who also didn't play in the tournament,
but who directed it throughout the day.

Thanks to Bill Saltman for the great pictures linked above, and a
few more here:
